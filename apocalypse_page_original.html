        <h1>How the World Could End</h1>
        <p class="Teaser">Scenarious that spell the end of life as we know it.</p>

    <div class="Content">
        <p><span class="LeadIn">Right now</span>, you're probably feeling pretty good.
            After all, life in the developed world is comfortableâ€”probably more
            comfortable than it's been for the average human being throughout all
            of recorded history.</p>
        <p>
            But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all
            fall apart. In this article, you'll learn about a few of our favorites.
        </p>
        <h2>Mayan Doomsday</h2>
        <p> Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new
            5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually predict a life-ending
            apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about
            virtually everything else, why should we trust them on this? </p>
        <h2>Robot Takeover</h2>
        <p>
            Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead Takeover,
            a robot rebellion is still a disquieting thought. We are already
            outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates fears
            the day his Japanese robot slave turns him over by the ankles and
            asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"
        </p>
        <h2>Unexplained Singularity</h2>
        <p>
            We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't
            just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more exciting than a
            puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.
